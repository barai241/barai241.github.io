  <h1>ROMANCE</h1>
  
   <p class="q1"> Ira Baran: 
Do you like watching movies and why?</p>
      <p class="s1" ></p>
      <p class="a1"> Aarya Kini: 
Even though I don't do it as often anymore, I do enjoy watching movies, especially with friends. I love to talk and discuss things that I watch with other people, so for one, it is just a great social activity for me. But apart from being good entertainment, I think some movies can really show you different realities that make you reflect on your own life. I like movies that are rooted in the current world for that reason because they always make me think of what could have been or what could be in the future. </p>

<p class="q2">Ira Baran: 
Do you get any specific feelings or emotions while watching a certain movie genre? </p>
<p class="s2"></p>
<p class="a2">Aarya Kini: 
I think that it depends on the specific movie more than the genre. I tend to really scrutinise aspects of a movie that make it deviate from reality, so the movies I can actually get emotionally invested in are movies that are based in familiar environments and situations - basically ones that could exist in real life. </p>
<p class="q3">Ira Baran: 
What is your favorite movie genre?</p>
<p class="s3"></p>
<p class="a3">Aarya Kini: 
If I could say "good movies", that would be my answer! I am by no means a movie connoisseur so I just watch ones that look interesting to me or have good reviews. So I don't really think I have any specific favourite genre, however I do tend to watch a lot of comedy and action movies. I also really like watching CGI heavy films just because I like to be in awe of the skill it takes to make them.</p>
<p class="q4">Ira Baran: 
Who's your favorite actor (or/and) actress? </p>
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="a4">Aarya Kini: 
This is also such a tough question because it is hard to pick one, but if I had to choose, right now I'd say Nicole Kidman. </p>
<p class="q5">Ira Baran: 
What do you think makes a good actor/actress?</p>
<p class="s5"></p>
<p class="a5">Aarya Kini: 
I think one of the most important skills a good actor or actress will have is versatility. Personally I find it so powerful and impressive when an actress can play a number of varied roles equally well because it shows the deep understanding of human nature that they possess. Apart from that, I think an ability to understand a character and portray them in a distinct way really makes an actor more memorable to me.</p>
<p class="q6">Ira Baran: 
What is your favorite movie/movies?</p>
<p class="s6"></p>
<p class="a6">Aarya Kini: 
My favourite movie is a Hindi movie called Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. Loosely translated, it means You Only Live Once.
</p>
<p class="q7">Ira Baran: 
Could you give a little description, please.</p>
<p class="s7"></p>
<p class="a7">Aarya Kini: 
The movie is about three childhood best friends who go on a road trip across Spain and in the process, meet new people and go on new adventures that make them reflect on their own lives and relationships. I think it is such a beautiful, relatable movie that just makes me feel good every time I watch it. It is also produced so well and the imagery, dialogue and soundtrack of the film is just so fitting and enjoyable even on it's own. I also love that the movie was written and directed by two very talented women.
</p>
<p class="q8">Ira Baran: 
Is there a specific moment, scene in the movie that you find powerful? 
</p>
<p class="s8"></p>
<p class="a8">Aarya Kini: 
There is a scene in which the three friends are participating in the running of the bulls in Pamplona and they make a pact to change certain aspects of their lives if they make it through the event alive. Obviously, they don't die, but there is a moment in between where they all just narrowly escape being trampled by one of the bulls. The slow-motion scene in which they all pause to look at each other and then collectively decide to continue running is such a heartwarming moment between friends. I think there is also a more subtle underlying meaning, but that needs to be contextualised by the rest of the film.

</p>
<p class="q9">Ira Baran: 
Do you think movies change the way you view life? If yes, then how? 
</p>
<p class="s9"></p>
<p class="a9">Aarya Kini: 
To me, movies are primarily a source of entertainment, so while I do like to reflect on them and discuss them with my friends, I don't think they necessarily change the way I view life. But I am sure that for other people this must be different. I think it just depends on how one approaches movies, and for what purpose you are watching them..
</p>
<p class="q10">Ira Baran: 
Why do you think superhero movies like Marvel, DC etc, have become so popular lately? 
</p>
<p class="s10"></p>
<p class="a10">Aarya Kini: 
I think firstly because there is so much background on the plots because of the comic books, and then also multiple movies on the same set of characters that it is easy for people to get deeply invested in them. The main cast has also not changed in a decade so that consistency also helps to build a large following. Additionally, I think the fact that they provide a kind of escapist fantasy from a world that can be quite bleak and devastating at times is also another reason they are so popular.</p>
