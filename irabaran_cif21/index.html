	<h1>HELLO</h1>
	<h2>This is an interview where I (Ira Baran) ask Aarya Kini questions about her movie preferences, what she think about todays cinematography and opinion on the effect it has on the viewer. I think that today the digital breakthrough shifted the way humans percieve information especially the digital image. It became an integral part of our life. That is why I took movies as one of the ways and conducted an interview. </h2>
