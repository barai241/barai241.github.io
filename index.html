          This course exposes students to thorough and elaborate interactive concepts and techniques
for applications. It is an extensive investigation in the interface, the mechanism, the controls and
the aims of interactive works. Students will learn how to design and develop complex interactive

process from brainstorming to the final outcome. They will be given the tools to conceive, plan
and develop an interactive system and they will become aware of the importance of their role in

          <p>
            In this projects I tell a story of planning a trip to Bali. The webpage looks like a conversetation from intagram and some of the texts have hidden links to see the recommended places such as hotels or restaurants.

          <h3><a href="projects/stories-as-networks/index.html">STORIES AS NETWORKS<i class="link"></i></a></h3>
          <p>
           Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentinian writer famous for his short stories that deal with labyrinths, dreams, religion, and mathematical ideas (particularly set theory concepts like infinity and cardinality). His circuitous and meandering prose, full of allusions and vivid imagery, is a good way to think about the web as a network that has many nodes and many connections that continuously folds upon itself. It is the act of navigating through this maze that brings meaning to the web experience.
